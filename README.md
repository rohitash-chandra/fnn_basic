 Feedforward Neural Network: Basic implementation in Python
 
 
#Feedforward Neural Network in Python (Classification Problem used for teaching and learning purpose)


#Sigmoid units used in hidden and output layer. gradient descent and stocastic gradient descent functions implemented
#this is best for teaching and learning as numpy arrays are not used   in Forward and Backward Pass.
#numpy implymentation with momemtum is given here: https://github.com/rohitash-chandra/VanillaFNN-Python
#corresponding C++ implementation which is generalised to any number of hidden layers is given here:
